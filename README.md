## 🧠 What is Apache Cassandra?

**Apache Cassandra** is a distributed NoSQL database built for handling large-scale, high-throughput workloads across multiple data centers and geographic regions — with no single point of failure.

Originally developed at Facebook and later open-sourced, Cassandra is now an Apache Software Foundation top-level project.

### 🔧 Key Features:

- Peer-to-peer architecture with no master node
- Linear horizontal scalability
- High write and read throughput
- Fault-tolerant and highly available
- Tunable consistency (AP in CAP theorem)
- Multi-data center replication
- CQL (Cassandra Query Language), a SQL-like syntax

---

## 👥 Who Should Use Cassandra?

Cassandra is ideal for scenarios where **real-time access to massive volumes of data** is required, and where **downtime is not acceptable**.

### ✅ Best Suited For:

- **Backend Engineers** building fault-tolerant APIs
- **Data Engineers** working with event streams or telemetry
- **DevOps/SRE** professionals managing distributed infrastructure
- **IoT Developers** collecting sensor data at scale
- **Product Teams** creating social, chat, or recommendation systems

### 🌍 Typical Use Cases:

- Real-time analytics and dashboards
- Logging and monitoring pipelines
- Messaging platforms
- Time-series and sensor data (IoT)
- Fraud detection in financial systems
- Social feeds and recommendation engines

## ✍️ About This Project

This project is part of a **10-day learning journey**, focused on:

- Learning core Cassandra concepts, syntax, and architecture
- Practicing real-world usage with examples and exercises
- Building confidence to use Cassandra in production scenarios
- Creating a long-term reference for myself and others

Feel free to fork this repo, clone it, or contribute if you’re learning too!
