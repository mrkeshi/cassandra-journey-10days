## What is Apache Cassandra?


**Apache Cassandra** is a distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large volumes of data with high throughput across multiple data centers â€” with no single point of failure.


Originally developed by Facebook and later open-sourced, Cassandra is now a top-level project under the Apache Foundation.


### Key Features


- Peer-to-peer architecture with no master node
- Horizontally linear scalability
- High performance in both reads and writes
- Fault tolerance and high availability
- Tunable consistency (AP in CAP theorem)
- Multi-datacenter replication
- CQL (Cassandra Query Language) with SQL-like syntax

## Who Should Use Cassandra?


Cassandra is ideal for scenarios where you need **real-time access to massive volumes of data** and **downtime is unacceptable**.


### Ideal For:


- **Backend engineers** building fault-tolerant APIs
- **Data engineers** working with telemetry or event data
- **DevOps/SRE teams** managing distributed infrastructure
- **IoT developers** collecting large-scale sensor data
- **Product teams** creating chat, social, or recommendation systems


### Common Use Cases:


- Real-time analytics and dashboards
- Logging pipelines and monitoring systems
- Messaging platforms
- Time-series data and IoT
- Fraud detection in financial systems
- Social feeds and recommender engines

## About This Project


This is part of a **10-day learning roadmap**, focusing on:


- Learning Cassandraâ€™s core concepts, syntax, and architecture
- Practicing real-world use cases with examples and exercises
- Building confidence to use Cassandra in production scenarios
- Creating a long-term reference for myself and others


Feel free to fork or clone the repository, and contribute if you'd like!

## Suggested Contribution Areas


You're welcome to contribute in the following ways:


**Add new examples**  
Include advanced examples for CQL queries, real-world table design, and combined queries.


**Improve documentation**  
Edit and expand both Persian and English docs, fix grammar and structure issues, and create step-by-step guides.


**Write test scenarios**  
Provide test data, `.cql` scripts, and verification examples.


**Create data modeling guides**  
Document performance-focused data modeling principles and partitioning strategies.


**Add tools and scripts**  
Provide Docker Compose setups, seed data scripts, and other helpful development utilities.


**Examples in different languages**  
Implement connection examples using Python, Java, Node.js, etc.


**Translate to other languages**  
Make Cassandra learning accessible to global users by translating this content.
